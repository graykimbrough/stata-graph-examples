# stata-graph-examples

Stata code to reproduce some of the figures I have tweeted, using publicly available IPUMS data (which you will need to download separately).

The [uncluttered-stata-graphs](https://gray.kimbrough.info/uncluttered-stata-graphs/) code and instructions will allow you to produce figures that look like mine. For animated .gifs, this code calls the (using !) [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/) convert command.
